# egt-lab
Experimental exploration of evolutionary game theory and unsupervised environment design

## Build core deep learning skills 
- [x] Build backprop from scratch using my version of Karpathy's method
- [x] Use JAX method to understand backprop on MNIST
- [x] Flax Linen MNIST practice
- [x] Flax NNX MNIST practice
- [ ] Optax MNIST practice
- [ ] Orbax MNIST practice

## GANS
- [ ] Implement a GAN and look at training dynamics

## First ecology experiment: predict the climate
- [ ] year can be wet or dry 
- [ ] environment agent gets to select the probability
- [ ] agent gets to select the action (germinate or not)
