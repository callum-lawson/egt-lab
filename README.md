Experimental exploration of evolutionary game theory and unsupervised environment design

## Build core deep learning skills
- Build backprop from scratch using my verison of Karpathy's method
- Use JAX method to understand backprop on MNIST
- Implement a GAN and look at training dynamics 

## First ecology experiment: predict the climate
- year can be wet or dry 
- environment agent gets to select the probability
- agent gets to select the action (germinate or not)
